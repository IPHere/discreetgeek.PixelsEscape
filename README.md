Hi everyone! Welcome to Circuit Sprint: Pixel’s Escape.
In this game, you play as Pixel, a cyber-girl trying to escape a corrupt digital lab.
The goal is to collect 5 corrupted data chips and reach the exit portal before time runs out.
Along the way, Pixel must dodge enemies, jump over firewalls, and navigate glitch zones that flip your controls.
I designed this level using GDevelop. Pixel’s sprite and the laser walls were hand-drawn for this project.
The game includes five custom sound effects for jumping, chip collection, taking damage, game over, and unlocking the portal.
Thank you for watching — and follow me on youtube.com/@discreetgeek.solutions for more projects!
